Wiizard Player
======================
A simple Qt/Phonon-based player that can be controlled with a Wiimote.
Simply place the source code of [libwiimote](http://libwiimote.sourceforge.net/) in the "libwiimote" folder and compile. Connect a Wiimote (the text area will turn green if successful, if not, close and reopen and try again.)

Commands:
  - `Home`: stop, `A`: play, `B`: pause.
  - `Left/right`: prev/next
  - `+/-`: increase/decrease volume.
